unit test is good - isolation

Unit test should only test the unit of code they target, the function or method that's being tested

This ensures that any success or failure of the test is caused by the behavior of the unit in question and doesn't result from some external factor 
like the network being down or a database server being unresponsive

In other words, when testing a function or method, 
we want to make sure that we're focusing on checking that the code in that function or method behaves correctly. 

When developing test, if for any reason we do need to interact with some other software, 
we'll normally do that in a test environment, where we'll have control over how it behaves. 

So the goal of the unit test is to verify that small, isolated parts of a program are correct.
 Given a known input, does the output of our code match our expectations?
